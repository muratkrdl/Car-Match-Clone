### 🎨 Meaning of Colors

| Color  | Meaning                    |
|:--------|:---------------------------|
| ⚪ Gray   | Represents **Space**         |
| ⚫ Black  | Represents **Obstacle**      |
| 🔵 Blue   | Represents **ColorType1**    |
| 🟢 Green  | Represents **ColorType2**    |
| 🟣 Purple | Represents **ColorType3**    |
| 🔴 Red    | Represents **ColorType4**    |
| 🟡 Yellow | Represents **ColorType5**    |

⚠️ **Note:** Colors in the level editor do **not** represent car colors.

#### Color types are random, for example, color type 1 is determined randomly in the same level, so the color of the cars changes every time even though one level is the same.
